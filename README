Some basic scripts are gather here.

a) the restart test : "2+2=4"

script: tst_2+2
- to use in a run dir. after a successful "testreport"
- input argument: '0','1','2','3','4' or 'All':
  proceed step by step or all steps at once
- tst_2+2 (no argument) -> print "usage"
- know problems: specific restart procedure (with fizhi pkg or offline pkg)
  not yet implemented

script: do_test_2+2
- call restart test "tst_2+2" multiple times, in every test experiment.
- needs to be in MITgcm/verification (with a copy of tst_2+2i script)
  and can only be used after a successful "testreport"
- do_test_2+2 -help -> print "usage"

NOTE: scripts "tst_2+2" & "do_test_2+2" have been moved (Dec 25, 2007) 
 to: MITgcm/tools

script: tst_2+2_cpl
 = version of tst_2+2 adapted for coupled set-up (verification/cpl_aim+ocn)

b) PBS-batch script that re-submit itself (loop).
script: runScript

- used (and tested) on myrinet-3 cluster.
- suffer from a lack of meaningful comments.
- not specially design to be general and obviously
  need to be modified/customized for each set-up.

c) A short script to split the ASCII Diagnostics-Stats output file
   into separated files (one per field) that are easy to read/load
   (e.g., in matlab, just use "load" command)
script: extract_StD
 no known dependency
+  A matlab script to load in 1 array all the separated files:
matlab-script: read_StD.m
 no known dependency
+  2 example scripts to make simple plots from Stat-Diags output:
matlab-script: grph_StD.m (uses read_StD.m)
matlab-script: plot_StD.m (uses read_StD.m, c_levs.m)

d) script: rn_pickup
- Rename 'pickup*.ckpt[A,B].*' files to 'pickup*.[10-digits-iter].*'
  with several selection options
- rn_pickup (no argument) -> print "usage"
