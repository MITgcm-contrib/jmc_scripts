Some basic scripts are gather here. 
They are not specially design to be general and obviously 
need to be modified/customized for each application.

a) the restart test : "1+1=2"
script: tst1+1
 call 2 short scripts: rnp & add0upto10c

* no input argument but few comments within the file tst1+1
  (needs to be edited and modify).
* an example of data.tst file is provided 
Note: the script is sensitive to space and upper-case / lower
  case characters regarding nIter0 line and nTimeSteps line.

b) PBS-batch script that re-submit itself (loop).
script: runScript
 call 2 short scripts: add0upto3c & add0upto10c

* used (and tested) on myrinet-3 cluster.
* suffer from a lack of meaningful comments.
  
c) A short script to split the ASCII Diagnostics-Stats output file
   into separated files (one per field) that are easy to read/load 
   (e.g., in matlab, just use "load" command)
script: extract_StD
 no known dependency
 + A matlab script to load in 1 array all the separated files:
matlab-script: read_StD
 no known dependency
